        <p>Python is a<b><i><u> high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.</i></b></u>
          <br> Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 
           <br> Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
        <br> It supports multiple programming paradigms, including<b> structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.</b>
        <br> It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
       <br> Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. </p>
